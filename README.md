# KookyCookingClub-website
Created a website with PHP and SQL

I decided to base my project on a cooking club website. A website with 5 webpages, Home, About, Classes, Events and Registration. 
Users can book classes and events through the website. 
All bookings, payments and registration details will be taken from the website and stored in tables in a database.
Users passwords will be encrypted before being stored into the database.
This database will also have tables containing information on the courses, events and venues.
Admin can add, update and delete events, classes etc.
I used Bootstrap to help design some of the pages which are generated from the database.
